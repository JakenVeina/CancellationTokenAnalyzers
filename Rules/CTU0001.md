# CTU0001 -  CancellationToken available, but not supplied 

Generally, `CancellationToken` values should be carried down through every level of an `async` call stack. When the analyzer detects that a method call is "cancellable", and a `CancellationToken` is available within the scope of that call, but was not provided, this warning will be triggered.

A method is considered "cancellable" if it accepts a `CancellationToken` parameter, whether optional or not, or if an overload or extension method exists whose signature is identical, except for the presence of a `CancellationToken` parameter.

If a method is intentionally being called in a not-cancellable manner, the simplest workaround to disable this warning is to supply `CancellationToken.None` to the method.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
public async Task MyMethod(
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), cancellationToken);
}
```

## Solution

Supply the appropriate `CancellationToken` to the method.

```csharp
public async Task MyMethod(
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), cancellationToken);
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), cancellationToken);
}
```
